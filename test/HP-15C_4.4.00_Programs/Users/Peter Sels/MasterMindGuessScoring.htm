<h1>Master Mind Game: Guess Scoring Program</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
Press <span class="HP15CfKey">f</span> <span class="HP15CfKeyLabel">LBL</span> <span class="HP15CfKeyLabel">A</span> to start the program.<br>
<ol>
<li>You see "0," appearing on the HP screen.<br>
</li>
<li>Enter a number 'N' from 1 to 6. Press <span class="HP15CKey">R/S</span><br>
This represents both the number of digits in the number to guess as the maximum value for each of the digits. The minimum value for each digit is always 1.<br>
</li>
<li>The program then constructs an N digit random 'secret' number S.<br>
</li>
<li>The user now has to enter an N digit integer 'guess' number G. Press <span class="HP15CKey">R/S</span>.<br>
</li>
<li>The program 'scores' the guess by how many digit couples taking one from S and one from G on the same position are identical, we call this 'c' (from correct) and how many of the remaining digit couples (one from G and one from S, but in different positions) are the same, we call this 'd' (from displaced). The program returns g,cd in the display. Note that c+d <= N always holds.<br>
</li>
<li>Goto 4) [until in 5) you get an answer where G,cd looks like G,N0 with N the number of digits to entered, because that means that your guess G = the secret S and all N digits are in the right position (c==N, and none in the wrong position, d=0)].</li>
</ol>
<strong>Example:</strong><br>
<br>
N = 4<br>
Secret S = 2243<br>
Guess G = 4213<br>
Answer on HP display = 4223,21<br>
c = 2 since the 2 and the 3 match on positions 2 and 4 and<br>
d = 1 since from the leftover digits, 4 occurs in position 3 in the secret and in position 1 in the guess.<br>
The 1 in the guess (on position 3) does not occur in the secret, so the user gets no score for that. This is also the cuplrit for the fact that c+d here and not c+d=N.<br>
<br>
<strong>Note:</strong> It is possible for the user to enter digits > N. They will be compared as well, but just never lead to a score for that digit, nor for c nor for d.<br>
<br>
* To help with understanding the HP assembly code, the Python equivalent of the two checking functions calculating c and d, in its basic shape is shown here.<br>
<pre>
def calculate_n_correctly_positioned_digits(
    secret, guess, matched_secret, matched_guess):
    c = 0
    for i in range(0, N):
        if guess[i] == secret[i]:
            matched_secret[i] = '1'
            matched_guess[i] = '1'
            c += 1
    return c

def calculate_n_displaced_digits(
    secret, guess, matched_secret, matched_guess):
    d = 0
    for j in range(0, N):
        for k in range(0, N):
            if matched_secret[j] == '0':
                if matched_guess[k] == '0':
                    if secret[j] == guess[k]:
                        matched_secret[j] = '1'
                        matched_guess[k]  = '1'
                        d += 1
    return d
</pre><br>
However, after (affine) loop (index) transformation we come to this single unified function, calculating both c and d, with only two nested (be it transformed) loops.<br>
<pre>
def calculate_all_digits(secret, guess, check_index_order=True):
    c = 0
    d = 0
    for diag in range(0, N):
        for on_diag in range(0, N):
            j = on_diag % N # say vertical
            k = (diag + on_diag) % N # say horizontal
            if matched_secret[j] == '0':
                if matched_guess[k] == '0':
                    if secret[j] == guess[k]:
                        matched_secret[j] = '1'
                        matched_guess[k]  = '1'
                        if j==k:
                            c += 1
                        else:
                            d += 1
    return c,d
</pre><br>
<br>
Note the the Python code above uses offset 0 in all indices, while the HP-15C code uses offset 1 in all indices (since R[0] and R[.0] are already used for other purposes).<br>
