    JRPN 15C/16C - User Guide
</p>
<p>
This is the user guide for JRPN 15C and JRPN 16C calculator 
simulators.  The main page is
<a href="index.html">here</a>.
<p>
Both simulators try to be a faithful implementation of the behavior
of the original 1980s calculator.  For the most part, the user guide
for the original calculators applies.  It can readily be found on the
internet.  Those guides aren't copied here because I'm unsure of
copyright, and JRPN is a clean-room implementation.
<p>
This guide concentrates on some slight extensions, and various settings
that are part of the application.  Be aware that the calculation results
in floating point modes can be expected to diverge somewhat from the
original calculator.  JRPN maintains floating-point numbers internally
as a binary-coded decimal value with a ten digit mantissa, like the
original.  However, for many calculations, the value is converted into
a standard 64 bit double, then the calculation is performed and the result
is converted back.  Other operations, like the 15C's integrate and solve
functions, almost certainly use a different algorithm than the
original.  With this said,
results are believed to be generally compatible, and in some cases slightly
more accurate.

<h2>The ON Button</h2>
<p>
The original calculators let you access special functions by simultaneously
pressing the ON butten and some other buttons.  In the simulator, press the
ON button once to access these functions; pressing it a second time quits
the program.  The other "hidden" features are swapping commas and decimal
points ("Euro mode"), a calculator reset, and a calculator self-test.

<h2>Settings</h2>
<p>
Note that some settings are only available on mobile platforms
(Andriod and IOS).
<ul>
    <li><b>Show Menu Icon</b> - If unchecked, gets rid of the 
        Android-style dots that provide a visual cue that a menu
        is there.  In this mode, you still access the menu by pressing
        in the upper-right hand corner of the UI.
    </li>
    <li><b>Disable System UI Overlays</b> (mobile) - Hides Android/IOS
        system UI elements, so you just see the calculator.</li>
    <li><b>Orientation</b> (mobile) - Lets you lock the orientation to
        portrait or landscape.  Personally, I leave this locked to
        landscape, since this simulates the real calculator.</li>
    <li><b>Key Feedback</b> - Lets you force a key feedback different
        than the platform default.  For example, on Android the default
        platform key feedback is a click, but I prefer haptic feedback.
        If you want key feedback on Android, <b>make sure you have 
        "Touch sounds" and/or "Touch vibration" enabled in your device 
        settings.</b>

        <a href="https://github.com/zathras/jrpn/issues/63">Issue 63</a>.
    </li>
    <li><b>Long Numbers</b> - Controls how long numbers are displayed,
        like "123456789ABCDEF0 h" or "-1.234567891 27".  The default
        is to behave like the original calculator.  In landscape mode,
        the LCD display can be stretched enough to fit a 64 bit hex
        number.  The digit size ca also be shrunk to fit more in.</li>
    <li><b>Show Accelerators</b> - Shows keyboard accelerators.</li>
    <li><b>System Settings, ms/Program Instruction</b> - lets you control
        how fast programs execute.  By default, the calculator delays for
        50ms after each instruction, which generally yields performance about
        3x the original in my experience.</li>
    <li><b>System Settings, Colors</b> - lets you tweak various colors in
        the UI, by entering a hex RGB value.  For example, if you like a
        slightly different shade of gold for the F key, you can set it here.
        </li>
    <li><b>System Settings, Debug Log</b> - captures debug information,
        including a record of keypresses, in an internal memory buffer.
        This information is included if you copy the calculator state
        to the clipboard in the File menu, and might be useful for a
        bug report.  To date, this has never been necessary.</li>
</ul>

<h2>File Menu - Read</h2>
<ul>
    <li><b>Restore Starting State</b> - Restores the calculator to its
        last saved state.</li>
    <li><b>Read from Clipboard</b> - Reads calculator state from the
        clipboard.  This can be used to copy it from JRPN on another
        device, by sending the string and copying it to the clipboard.</li>

</ul>

<h2>File Menu - Save</h2>
<ul>
    <li><b>Save as Starting State</b> - saves the current calculator state.
        The calculator does this automatically when it's shut down or when 
        you turn it off using the ON button, so normally this isn't needed.</li>
    <li><b>Copy to Clipboard</b> - Copies the current calculator state to
        the clipboard.  You can use this to send it to another copy of JRPN
        on a different device. </li>
    <li><b>Export to Application</b> - Like Copy to Clipboard, but sends
        the data to another program, e.g. using an Android intent.</li>
    <li><b>Copy URL to Clipboard</b> - Like the previous two, but encodes
        the state as a URL that can be used to launch the web version of
        JRPN.</li>
</ul>

<h2>File Menu - Import/Export Program</h2>
<p>
These menu options let you import and export a human-readable
program listing.  It may be possible to use this to send and receive
programs to/from other HP 15C/16C simulators.  The format is based
on the documentation from
<a href="https://hp-15c.homepage.t-online.de/homepage.htm">Torsten's
HP 15C Simulator</a>.  I added this feature at Torsten's request.

<h2>Reset All</h2>
<p>
Restores the simulator to its default settings.
