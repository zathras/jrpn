<p>JRPN 16C is calculator simulator inspired by the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP-16C" rel="nofollow">HP 16C</a>
"Computer Scientist"
calculator.  JRPN 15C is similarly inspired by the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP-15C" rel="nofollow">HP 15C</a>.
Both came out in 1982, and for my money, there were marvels of their time.
The 15C I bought in early '83 still works great!  If you're looking for
a user guide, it's available <a href="help.html">here</a>.
<h2>Project Goals</h2>
<p>
I've tried to make them work the same as a
real 16C/15C, and to mimic the appearance as closely as possible.  This is a
completely clean-room implementation; I didn't have access to any of the
calculators' source code.  I just read the manuals (very closely!), asked a 
<a href="https://www.hpmuseum.org/forum/thread-16595-post-146096.html">question</a>
or two about how the real thing behaves, and I played around with a couple
of other simulators out there.  A couple of algorithms were ported from 
Torsten's Tcl code (e.g. for numeric integration), but they are known to not
be based on HP's code.
<p>
The User's Guide for each simulator is basically the Owner's Handbook,
which can be easily found on the web.  A couple of little things are different:
<ul>
    <li>To access the functions you normally get by holding the on button and
        pressing another, you press the on button (with the calculator "on"),
        and then press the other button.  To turn the calculator off,
        you press "on" twice.
    <li>The calculator state is saved when the application is quit, or when
        you request it (e.g. ON-ON, or File -> Save Starting State).  It
        is possible to terminate an application without giving it a chance
        to save (e.g. by pulling the plug on a computer, kill -9 on Unix,
        etc.).
    <li>You can disable the windowing function on the 16C.  If you do,
        then the LCD grows and/or the digits shrink so that they all fit.
        They get pretty small on a 64 bit binary number!  You can
        disable windowing from settings, or temporarily on the 16C by pressing
        CLEAR-PREFIX in integer mode.
    <li>On the 15C, you can similarly enable the display of long numbers.
        This will grow the LCD or shrink the digits when necessary so it 
        can e.g. fit scientific notation numbers with 10 digits of 
        precision (f-SCI-9).
    <li>You can copy the contents of the display to the clipboard.
    <li>From the menu, you can share the calculator state, either 
        to/from the clipboard, or to an application.
    <li>The app can interpret a URL that contains an encoding of
        the calculator state.  This works in the web version, and
        also on the mobile versions:  The Android app
        registers to intercept navigation to the calculator's domain.
    <li>If you want calculator programs to run faster, there's a 
        setting for that.  But watching the 7-segment flashing 
        "running" message is, to my mind, part of the fun!
    <li>You can import and export programs in a reasonable human-readable
        format.  The 15C's program files should be compatible with
        Torsten's <a href="https://hp-15c-simulator.de/">outstanding
        simulator</a>
    <li>There's a nifty "view calculator internals" screen that lets you see 
        what's going on inside.
</ul>

<h2>Why Another Calculator Simulator?</h2>
<p>
One nice aspect of these simulators is that they scale the UI to any screen size, without
any pixelization.  The entire UI is drawn using graphics primitives (with the exception
of a logo on the back panel), so it should never look "grainy."  As for me, I
mostly wrote these because it was fun.
<p>
A bit of history:  I bought a 15C when I was a freshman at UCLA, back in
January of 1983.  It still works great, but while traveling it was nice to
have a good calculator on my laptop.  I used Torsten's 
<a href="https://hp-15c-simulator.de/">15C simulator</a>
starting in the late '90s, mostly on MacOS.
<p>
Much later, I ran across
<a href="http://www.emmet-gray.com/" rel="nofollow">Emmet
Gray's</a> wonderful <a href="http://www.wrpn.emmet-gray.com/">WRPN
calculator</a>.  I always wanted a 16C, but I never really <i>needed</i> it,
and I was a starving student at the time :-)  WRPN works great on Android, but
the UI uses images that were created back when screen resolutions weren't so
high, so I dropped Emmet a line, and re-did some of the UI and published 
that as what I'm now calling
<a href="https://legacy.jrpn.jovial.com/">"Legacy JRPN"</a>.
<p>
When COVID hit, I had some spare time :-)  I was playing around with Flutter,
and decided it would be fun to do a complete rewrite, with the goal of making
the UI a close match to the real calculator.  Starting with the LCD display,
I went to <a href="https://jrpn.jovial.com/dartdoc/view.lcd_display/Segments-class.html">ridiculous
lengths</a> to mimic the real appearance.  The result is a calculator with a
UI that's completely drawn from graphics primitives, so it can scale to any
screen size or resolution, across a wide variety of platforms.
<p>
My still-working 15C from 1983 sits on my desk most of the time, and
it just seemed to make sense to make a 15C simulator off of the same codebase.
So I did.  I must say, I have a whole new level of appreciation fot the
sophistication of the 15C.  The amount of functionality they were able to pack
into such limited hardware is amazing!

<h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the 12C?</h3>
<p>
JRPN is a hobbyproject; there's no revenue of any sort.  I don't have any
plans to make a 12C version.  If anyone wants to build a 12C from the code,
go ahead!  It's open-source with a permissive license.  I'd be happy to answer
wuestions about JRPN's internals.

Full source is available <a href="https://github.com/zathras/jrpn/">here</a>.
It's built using Google's <a href="https://flutter.dev/">Flutter</a>, which
means it can be built for a large variety of platforms.  It's available
free of charge, and doesn't do any advertising or tracking or anything
like that; it's basically a labor of love.  Of course, there is no warranty
of any kind.  For avoidance of doubt:

<p>
The input model for these calculators is very
sophisticated -- it's a little like "vi" in terms
of getting the most out of limited hardware.  The
simulator is a bit like a modern Harley Davidson
motorcycle.  I rented one once, and they engineer in a
certain amount of vibration and engine noise that are
totally unnecessary, but that make you feel like you're
"taming the iron horse."  In a similar way, this simulator displays 
results on what looks like a limited 7 segment display (though it will 
scale it down to fit in more digits, if you enable that in the settings.).
It includes a slight delay and a bit of a blink on the LCD
when you do a calculator operation, and in other ways it
attempts to behave like a 1982-vintage calculator running on a low-power
4 bit CPU.

<h2><a name="Web">Web Version</h2>
<p>
The web version of JRPN works pretty well, but the web target for
Google's Flutter sometimes comes with nasty
<a href="https://github.com/zathras/jrpn/issues/116">surprises</a>.  To
be clear, I don't particularly blame the Dart team -- JavaScript is an
awfully shaky foundation on which to implement decent language semantics,
and I'm sure the team can't wait to jettison it in favor of WASM.  Anway,
JRPN's web versions do work, but the primary, best-supported platforms for 
JRPN are desktop and mobile phone.

<h2><a name="Install">Installing</h2>
<p>
You can get JRPN 16C and 15C at the following locations:
<ul>
    <li>Android app store:  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jovial.jrpn15">JRPN 15C</a> and
        <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jovial.jrpn2">JRPN 16C</a>.</li>
    <li>Linux Snap store:  <a href="https://snapcraft.io/jrpn15" rel="nofollow">JRPN 15C</a> and <a href="https://snapcraft.io/jrpn16" rel="nofollow">JRPN 16C</a></li>
    <li>Windows app store:  <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/jrpn-15c/9P2FG47MD49M" rel="nofollow">JRPN 15C</a> and <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/jrpn-16c/9NHCLCBXP7T5" rel="nofollow">JRPN 16C</a>, with icons <a href="https://github.com/zathras/jrpn/tree/main/misc">here</a> if you need them.</li>
    <li>The <a href="https://github.com/zathras/jrpn/">Github Repository</a>
        has source, and binaries for MacOS, iOS, and an Android universal APK,
        under
        <a href="https://github.com/zathras/jrpn/releases">releases</a>.
    <li>For MacOS circa 2025 (Sequoia / 15.x), there are some new hoops 
        to jump through the first time launching.  The first time, it will 
        refuse to launch.  The "launch anyway" option is hidden, under
        System Settings -> Privacy & Security, toward the bottom.  You
        only have to do this once.
    <li>For iOS, it might be available through my friend's developer account, at
        <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/jrpn-15c/id6484504019">JRPN
        15C</a> and
        <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/jrpn-16c/id6484402697">JRPN
        16C</a>.  I have heard reports of a "not available in your region"
        error at times.  I'm not sure what hoops Apple makes my friend jump
        through to keep this current, so no promises!
    <li>Dartdoc documentation for the source is
        <a href="dartdoc/index.html">available here</a>.
</ul>

<p>
The problem with Apple is that in order to give
away software for free, you have to pay Apple $100 a year for the privilege.
It's not really about the amount of money -- it's also about the ongoing 
hassle.  I vaguely remember there being something about Apple wanting me to 
own an iOS phone in order to publish for iOS, too.  Me, I have a cheap Android
phone that I replace maybe every five years.  Anyway, the source builds and
runs fine for iOS.
